====== TODO ======
Created Friday 11 April 2014

I'm going to set up a javascript file to take mouse over events for buttons, to change the wrapper background image
We already have most of the sites functionailty, It is after all just a webpage with buttons.

The versioning system used will be as follows

major.minor.patch:

    Major version numbers change whenever there is something significant, a large or potentially backward-incompatible change to a software package.
    Minor version numbers change when a new, minor feature is introduced, or when a set of smaller features is rolled out.
    Patch numbers change when a new build of the software is released to customers. This is normally for small bugfixes or the like.

[[version:0.1.0|0.1.0]]
	make all buttons work and provide pages for each button. The site is essentially functional but wont be deployed yet
