====== 1.3.0 ======
Created Tuesday 20 May 2014

will give each image box a picture representing a skill and make it small but not scaled, when the 'mask' is scaled up, it will reveal the image
this transition will be animated with a 200ms or so delay

I have this working for the most park.

turns out that at least with my skill level, you can't easily 'place' a scaled image and I have set the images up in a row to make it easy to toggle them
