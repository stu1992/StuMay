====== 0.2.0 ======
Created Saturday 12 April 2014

I will introduce javascript functionality in the home page with button mouse overs
If a button is moused over, after a second, the wrapper image will change

I will have basic interactivity and the page will look good

After research into this. I have decide that having a opacity fade is not worth the effort redesigning the page
I will try again to make the screen go white]

I'm calling this done. It goes white then gives me the other picture, this is what I originally wanted and the alternative is a bit too much work for the little payoff
