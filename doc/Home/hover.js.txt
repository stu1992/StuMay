// this will handle verticle movement of buttons

<script>
function show_coords(event)
{
var x=event.clientX;
var y=event.clientY;
alert("X coords: " + x + ", Y coords: " + y);
}
</script>

this script shows that you can get relative mouse positions
I can add div elements into each table data field, with that i can pass the relative mouse position (which will eliminate a lot of messy calculations
i can also pass the element number so i know which button is being influenced and make the rest return to center if required
