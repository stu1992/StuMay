  	<h1>setting up the main page</h1>
  	So I've got a web server up and running and configured to a reasonable extent, the way i like it.
  	Now the simple task of justifying the energy expendature of the months leading up to finally getting all this off the ground.<br>
  	Let's add some content.
  	<p>
  		I know roughly what i want. A little bit of everything. I've played with LAMP
  		<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29"> (to check out)</a>
  		<a href="http://community.linuxmint.com/tutorial/view/486">(to install) </a>
  		and have gotten comfortable with basic website development, mainly 
focusing on php/mysql
  		 by making a proof of concept facebook mockup, the only really 
properly working part of which, was the authentication interface
  		 which i took much pleasure in bypassing with sql injection.
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		I have also dipped my toes into phpbb and am itching to adapt that into something unique.<br>
  		There are actually a lot of open source packages availible to use and i love that. I'm a big fan of open source ideology
  		 but sometimes it just isn't necessary. I had a quick look at wordpress<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WordPress">(to check out) </a>
  		  and while i was intrigued that a hefty percentage of the
  		 internet uses it(60 million users can't be wrong) I think you know you're a linux geek when you think the worlds
  		 most popular content management system looks incredibly bloated.<br>
  	</p>
  	<p>
  		I'm not dissing wordpress though. I'm just naively a fan of 
reinventing the wheel. I don't want to use some resource heavy
  		framework when i can implement the functionality myself and get only
 what i need and an interesting learning experience out of it.<br>
  		I decided what i wanted was several easily organised projects with a central interface which will be my home page.<br>
  		If i was to use a foreign package this might not be straight forward.
  	</p>
  	Well my designing skills are piss weak, but i'll take a shot

		I have my banner up top with a logo i literally made up on the spot but i like it :)<br>
		I'll have a photo of my in the corner because i'm in love with myself and links to
		the projects i've embarked on floating in the space between (blog, forum, etc).
		the main body of the page will be updates regarding anything relating to said projects and
		to the right will be a little 'about' thing i recon. 
	</p>
	Since setting up the site on my actual screen, I realized that the gap between the updates and 'about'
	is actually quite reasonable and decided to put pictures relating to the messages on the left
	<p>
		One of the few things i can thank uni for is a method of web design
		that i hadn't considered previously. This involves using photoshop or <a href="http://www.gimp.org/">an equevilant program</a>
		to draw rectangles to design the layout of all the elements of the webpage.<br>
	</p>
	You see, everything in a web page can be described in terms of <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp">the box model</a><br>
	<a href="nope">
  	<img src="index_files/box_model.png">
	</a>
	<p>
		Something that after 5 years splashing in the kiddy pool of the I.T industry, i should know by now is that proper planning is
		invaluable to success and avoiding spending unecessary hours sitting infront of my laptop. I'm just going to pretend that
		 i got this right to begin with and didn't just have a vague idea in my head as i spammed &lt;div&gt; tags into 
		 <a href="http://www.aptana.com/">apanta studio</a>
